4. Drag "RSDKv5" folder to the root of your SD card or USB stick
5. Open \RSDKv5\Sonic1 folder and drag your Data.rsdk file into there (must be from Sonic Origins Plus, which is named Sonic1u.rsdk, rename that to data.rsdk)
5.5. You can find the Origins Plus RSDKs here: https://ia600506.us.archive.org/view_archive.php?archive=/16/items/origins-plus-rsdk/Origins%20Plus%20RSDK.zip

8. Done! (Sound effects that are built in will be in a later release)
